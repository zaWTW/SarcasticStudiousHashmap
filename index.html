My name is Zion Quintyne and I am a student at longwood high school. I am a freshman going into my sophmore year with extra credits. I am a very hard working man who is always trying to get the best out of every situation. Just to name some of the things I like, I love money, clothes, and shoes. I also love to play video games listen to music, and most importantly, I love to praise god.
